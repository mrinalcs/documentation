## Introduction to R

R is an open-source programming language and software environment designed for statistical analysis, data visualization, and data manipulation. It was developed by statisticians and data scientists for a wide range of applications, from basic data analysis to complex statistical modeling.

## Getting Started

To start using R, you need to install it on your computer. You can download R from the [R Project website](https://www.r-project.org/). Additionally, it's recommended to use an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, such as [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), which provides a user-friendly interface and various tools for coding and visualization.

After installing R and RStudio, you're ready to start writing and running R code. Create a new script or R Markdown document to write and execute your code.

## Data Manipulation

R offers a variety of packages and functions for data manipulation. You can import data from various formats, clean and preprocess it, and perform operations like filtering, merging, and reshaping. Commonly used packages include `dplyr` and `tidyr`.
